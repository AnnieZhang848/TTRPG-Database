# TTRPG-Database
This program is being developed as a personal tool to help organize my collection of TTRPGs.
Up until recently all the data was being hosted locally but I am now in the process of modifying it so that it will be hosted on MongoDB instead. As such, many of the features are functional at the moment. (Depending on when you are viewing this, the entire program may not yet be functional, sorry!)

## Features
- Overview of all games in the database (Currently disabled)
- Filter games by tone (lighthearted vs serious), type (broadly, playstyle) and subject (game contents) (Currently disabled)
- Add new games directly in the application (Currently disabled)
- Edit pre-existing entries (Currently labeled as "Sort", currently disabled)

## Plans
- Finish migrating my old code over to a MongoDB based format
- Add the ability to add brief descriptions to the games which can be expanded at will

## How to Use
If you wish to use this code for yourself, simply edit the config file to have use your own MongoDB information.
